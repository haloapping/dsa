# Data Structure and Algorithm

## Content

- Implement commonly used data structures, such as Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Sort, Binary Tree, and others.
- Using Python programming language and TDD method.
- I recommend to use Visual Studio Code and install Test Explorer UI extension to open this project and run unit test.

## Motivation

- I find this very useful for sharpening logic and data structure recognition.
- I repeat in the course of algorithms and data structures. And when I retake the course I only got a C :(.
